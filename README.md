## Day 10
I've been coding for 10 days straight, so I decided to take the challenge seriously. Today I improved the homepage for the blog project and wrote a script to update the readme of this repo

## Day 11
I'm building a chrome extension that saves URLs, It's very simple, but I'm trying to keep the icon different for saved pages which makes the task harder because the documentation is terrible

## Day 12
I just completed the FreeCodeCamp certification (API and Microservices). Honestly, I don't think the platform works for me,  I get distracted pretty easily

## Day 13/14
Back to the chrome extension, I'm building the UI right now with [BaseWebReact](https://github.com/uber/baseweb), the goal is to build a full Pocket clone with a web and mobile app

## Day 15/16
Finishing some Udemy courses that I left on hold, that's what I'm going to do this week I guess

## Day 17
Still on Udemy, I thought I had a good understanding of React but that's definitely not true. To be honest, I am just studying to build the apps I need, I don't intend to delve into it

## Day 18/19
Tried Redux for the first time, it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, having a good understanding of javascript probably helped

## Day 20
Thanks to college I got a free account on FrontendMasters, started digging a little deeper into Node, first time working with streams

## Day 21/22
found good Node content on FrontendMasters that goes beyond just express apps

## Day 23/24
Spent a lot of time researching how to keep the user logged in using JWT, turns out it's not as easy as I thought, maybe one day I'll write the tutorial I didn't find

## Day 25/26/27
I refactored the blog project to use the mysql2 promise wrapper and then went back to the web version of the Pocket-like app and I'm building the UI right now, I just hate css

## Day 28/29/30
Since I didn't know what I wanted for the UI, I wasted a lot of time trying libraries and redoing things. Anyway, always make a prototype

## Day 31/32/33/34
the web app and extension are finally working together but with a few bugs, after fixing them I might start working on the mobile app

## Day 35/36
Fixed some usability bugs in the extension and started the mobile version

## Day 37/38
I took a little break from javascript, now I'm revisiting the basics of Go. That's what I'll do for the rest of the week

## Day 39/40/41/42
continuing with Go, I started a course to see what microservices is all about, nothing strange until now

## Day 43/44/45
I decided to go back to the RN app and was able to reuse a lot of code from the web version, I'm almost done

## Day 46/47/48/49/50
I haven't finished the app yet, I had to create a password reset system and build an image preview like when users share a link on social media

## Day 51/52/53/54/55
I finished the app but I spent three days trying to fix a refresh token bug, after some adjustments I can move on to another project
