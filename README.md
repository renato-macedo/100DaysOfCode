## Day 10

I've been coding for 10 days straight, so I decided to take the challenge seriously. Today I improved the homepage for the blog project and wrote a script to update the readme of this repo



## Day 11

I'm building a chrome extension that saves URLs, It's very simple, but I'm trying to keep the icon different for saved pages which makes the task harder because the documentation is terrible

## Day 12

I just completed the FreeCodeCamp certification (API and Microservices). Honestly, I don't think the platform works for me,  I get distracted pretty easily

## Day 13/14

Back to the chrome extension, I'm building the UI right now with [BaseWebReact](https://github.com/uber/baseweb), the goal is to build a full Pocket clone with a web and mobile app
